                        In my ongoing adventures in Japan, I always try to
                        experience new automotive events to expand my horizons.
                        Of course I don’t want to stray too far off the path of
                        things I love so it’s all still very Japanese-tuning
                        specific. When I found out that my friends from Final
                        Bout were hosting an event in Japan around the same time
                        as Tokyo Auto Salon, I knew I had to check it out.
                        Though it may be a driving competition hosted by
                        Americans, the competitors themselves as well as the
                        race track it is on is still very much Japanese. I knew
                        it would be a great opportunity to run into some new JDM
                        builds that I have never seen before. I was stoked to
                        also here that they were going to make this a
                        team-oriented competition as well and that’s one of the
                        features of Final Bout that I have enjoyed in year’s
                        past. Yasu had already flown back home to Osaka to
                        catch-up on work so on this day, I linked up with my
                        friend Cody Chan. He had already made plans to go with
                        some friends and he was able to squeeze me in last
                        minute since i hadn’t ever been to Nikko Circuit before.
                        One thing that stands out about this event is that STYLE
                        is a very important prerequisite. It doesn’t matter how
                        good you can drive, if your car doesn’t look good, what
                        the hell is the point??!{" "}

                        What a difference a week makes in Japan. I started off
                        my trip on a really chill mood, just walking around the
                        city and exploring new areas I’d never been to. Then a
                        week later all my friends arrived in Tokyo and it was
                        time to get back into work mode! Tokyo Auto Salon was
                        upon us and there were some great new builds to see, but
                        most of the fun was had after hours! There were meets
                        all weekend, including one hosted by Sara Choi and
                        your’s truly. Let’s just say things didn’t go as
                        planned, but hey, that’s just what happens in Japan….

                        I always try to make my way to Type One every time I go
                        back to Japan. In year’s past I’d message Aaron from
                        Spoon Sports USA to see if it was okay if I went over
                        there, worrying we’d get in the way or something. Better
                        to ask than to feel unwelcome, you know? Sometimes Aaron
                        would even be there to show us around. Give us a full
                        tour and show us some stuff the public doesn’t have
                        access to. My friends and I have created some great
                        memories at this place over the past decade. Nowadays
                        I’ll just send a quick message to Daisuke Jomoto from
                        Spoon to let him know I’m coming by to say{" "}

                        Happy new year!! 2024 is off to a great start as I make
                        my way back to Tokyo, Japan on the second day of the new
                        year. Unlike previous years, my trip to Japan comes even
                        earlier as I made plans to see and experience new things
                        before the annual Tokyo Auto Salon event. I spent time
                        with friends, attended a couple of car meets, and went
                        hunting for some rare gems. Then it was time to go
                        check-out the show and see what was new. There’s still
                        so much more to show you guys because I’ll be in Japan
                        for 48 days!…

                        After spending the first few days of the new year
                        exploring Tokyo on my own, I finally decided I needed to
                        be social and met-up with my good friend @zerosync. He
                        spends half of his year here in Japan and has his own
                        car(s) so he said he would take me around. Cody asked me
                        what I wanted to do and I told him I’m pretty much open
                        to anything. He took my words to heart and took me to
                        Costco so he could buy stuff for his place, lol. I mean,
                        I didn’t mind at all. You’d be surprised how often
                        people in Japan take me to Costco. It’s like if you take
                        me to Costco it automatically makes the Japanese Costco
                        somewhat more-American. I’m always there to support my
                        friends so let’s go make a day of it…

                        Well, I figured there would be no better way to put a
                        bow-tie on this fun project than to actually provide you
                        guys with some footage of it in modern-day 4K. This has
                        been such a fun project. After starting it one-day
                        randomly two years ago and then rehashing it all with
                        much more content in late 2023. It all started with the
                        basis of just having fun and being creative, imagining
                        an alternate timeline where The Chronicles would have
                        had a 16-bit racing game on a Super Nintendo console.
                        Obviously there were some liberties taken with how much
                        I could actually make look ’16-bit’ but I think for the
                        most part, it pulls off the feel of an old racing game
                        faithfully. There was a lot of inspiration taken from
                        some of my favorite games like Tokyo Xtreme Racer,
                        Option Tuning Car Battle and some more obscure titles
                        from Japan that I discovered over the years.

                        Man, it has been a hell of an amazing year. So much
                        traveling, so much car culture to experience and I’ve
                        met/reconnected with a lot of great people! I’ve had
                        some big projects this year and one of the byproducts of
                        working on these projects has been spending time with my
                        friends at Bowls LA. They’ve been plenty busy this year
                        with their own projects, hosting event after event at
                        their space. It’s been a real pleasure seeing Bowls
                        thrive. To close-out the year, we decided to take on one
                        final project. This one is gonna be a special one
                        though, all about giving back to the community with a
                        completely automotive-themed holiday party. While we
                        were planning it all out and decorating Bowls, there
                        were plenty of other events going on as well to keep us
                        occupied…

                        Next-up on my list of “Photos I should have posted a
                        long time ago” is a good one. Last year, I extended my
                        Spring trip to Japan a few extra days just so I could
                        attend the Chan-Oka Honda Meet in Saitama. I didn’t know
                        much about the event at the time other than it was an
                        all-Honda gathering being hosted at a private compound.
                        To me, it sounded like the early beginnings of the
                        Eibach Honda Meet back at home, just on a much smaller
                        scale. After I attended, I realized that was exactly
                        what it was supposed to be. Like it wasn’t supposed to
                        be a Japanese Eibach Honda Meet but more-so a (smaller)
                        Eibach Honda Meet in Japan, if that makes sense. The
                        latter is important because the Hondas that would be
                        exhibiting at the Chan-Oka Meet were catered to those
                        that enjoy Honda tuning in North America. The cars
                        represented there were an homage to the 2000s-2010s era
                        of Honda builds you’d see here at home. To me, that’s
                        probably the best era when it comes to Honda
                        modification and I’m glad so many in Japan seem to agree
                        with. A lot of their inspiration comes from looking
                        through magazines like Honda Tuning and Super Street,
                        which I also did quite a bit of work for, so it made
                        sense for me to attend. I don’t think that I am the
                        end-all and be-all of information when it comes to this
                        particular genre by any means—but I’d like to believe
                        that I am pretty knowledgeable and have enough
                        experience to help them curate this sub-community of
                        Honda enthusiasts…

                        Before I go back to Japan in a few weeks, allow me to
                        take you back to Japan to look at some more photos I
                        collected during my last trip. My original plans abroad
                        a couple months ago consisted of just going to Sydney,
                        Australia for the World Time Attack Challenge. It had
                        been a couple years since I had been back in New South
                        Wales and I promised Yasu that I would meet him there.
                        It was his first time and he wanted to see what
                        Australia was like so I agreed to join him. As usual, my
                        schedule was pretty jampacked so I totally forgot to
                        book my flight to Sydney until a week before. I don’t
                        know how many of you have booked international flights
                        before but trying to book them a week before departure
                        is usually a bad idea. Prices skyrocket last minute to
                        target procrastinators like myself and sure enough, I
                        found myself looking at roundtrip flights that were over
                        $2000. On average, if you were to book in a timely
                        fashion like normal humans, a flight to Sydney from Los
                        Angeles would range anywhere from $750 to $1200.
                        Anything over that is pretty outrageous but a promise is
                        a promise, so I wasn’t going to just leave Yasu by
                        himself in a country he had never been to…
